Brendan Rodgers' request for 'realism' suggests Celtic's new norm in Europe

Rodgers said he "could have made a couple of changes" but ultimately, he only opted to call on one.

A further four from the bench followed throughout the second half, but none matched the impact of the Nigeria international.

Rodgers can only play the cards he's dealt, which don't include replacements for stars of Champions League campaigns gone by in Kyogo Furuhashi, Nicolas Kuhn and Jota.

The former left in January, the latter is a long-term injury lay-off after returning to Celtic, while Kuhn was destined to depart - in no small part due to his star rising on the biggest of stages - yet still Celtic failed to fill the gaps.

Which is why Rodgers said he was left feeling "empty" after a scant summer of transfer activity and why supporters have been protesting in recent weeks.

There's plenty heat swirling around the club from the stands, and that was before they touched down in the Serbian capital.

Hence Rodgers' call for "realism" when analysing the result against the backdrop of a spell of three years in the Champions League now at an end.

"I think there needs to be a bit of realism," the Northern Irishman told TNT Sports.

"I think that we are where we are and I think that tonight is a good point.

"You're probably not going to go win all eight games, so I think there's a bit of realism needed to it.

"This is a good point for this squad of players and for us coming here.

"There'll always be criticism, but if you come to Belgrade and you get a point of a team that's won seven games out of seven [in the league] then we can really only focus on what we can do ourselves."
