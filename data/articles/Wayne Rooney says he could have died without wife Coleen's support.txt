Wayne Rooney says he could have died without wife Coleen's support

Wayne Rooney says he could have died had his wife Coleen not been there to help him manage problems with alcohol.

The 39-year-old former Manchester United and England captain says he was "struggling massively" with his drinking during his playing career.

Rooney - who scored a record 253 goals for United and retired from playing in 2021 - has been married to Coleen since 2008.

"I honestly believe if she weren't there I'd be dead," he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast., external

"I've made mistakes in the past which are well documented and whatever but I'm a little bit different at times and she keeps me on that path and she's done it for 20-odd years.

"I wanted to go out and enjoy my time with my friends and have a night out. It got to a point where I went too far - that was a moment in my life where I was struggling massively with alcohol.

"I didn't think I could turn to anyone. I didn't really want to because I didn't want to put that burden on anyone.

"I just drank for two days straight. Come training and at the weekend, I'd score two goals and then I'd go back and go and drink for two days straight again.

"She's helped me control that massively. She's managed me because I needed managing."
