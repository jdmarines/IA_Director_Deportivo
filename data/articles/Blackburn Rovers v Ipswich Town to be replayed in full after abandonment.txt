Blackburn Rovers v Ipswich Town to be replayed in full after abandonment

Blackburn Rovers' Championship fixture against Ipswich Town is to be replayed in full following its abandonment on Saturday.

The fixture was called off in the 79th minute due to heavy rainfall at Ewood Park making the pitch unplayable, with Blackburn leading 1-0 courtesy of Todd Cantwell's second-half penalty.

Cantwell's goal will now no longer stand given the game will be replayed, but Ipswich defender Jacob Greaves, who was sent off, will still have to serve a suspension.

In a statement, the EFL said a board meeting comprehensively considered all options available in accordance with the regulations and that it was decided "by a majority" that the game should be replayed in full.
