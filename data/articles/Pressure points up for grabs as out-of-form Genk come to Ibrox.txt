Pressure points up for grabs as out-of-form Genk come to Ibrox

An under-performing team, a sub-standard start to the season, a manager under serious pressure with supporters calling for his removal. Sound familiar?

For Rangers, read Genk. For Russell Martin, read Thorsten Fink. The parallels are uncanny between the clubs who will go head-to-head at Ibrox in their Europa League opener on Thursday night.

The difference is, Fink, unlike Martin, has already had a year in charge, a season that started superbly but tailed off before ending pretty badly, with just two wins from their last eight in the league, leaving Genk six points behind Club Brugge and nine behind champions Union St Gilloise, both of whom have been to Ibrox recently with contrasting fortunes.

Nonetheless, it represented Genk's highest placing since finishing runners-up in 2022-23 and supporters would have been hoping for another title challenge under the German Fink this season. (As an aside they last won the league in 2019 under none other than Philippe Clement.)

That seems a long shot even at this early stage, as they languish in 14th, just two places off the bottom with two wins from eight and already 12 points behind the leaders USG.
