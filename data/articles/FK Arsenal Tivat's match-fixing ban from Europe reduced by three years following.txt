FK Arsenal Tivat's match-fixing ban from Europe reduced by three years following appeal

Montenegerin club FK Arsenal Tivat's ban from European competitions for match-fixing has been reduced by three years following their appeal to Uefa.

In July the club was handed a 10-year ban by Uefa after an investigation into their 2023 Uefa Conference League first-round qualifying tie against Armenian side Alashkert.

Arsenal Tivat drew 1-1 at Alashkert before being beaten 6-1 at home in the reverse fixture.

The club's ban has now been reduced to seven years, while goalkeeper Dusan Puletic, who was also banned for 10 years, is free to play again after he won his appeal.

In July Uefa found the club had breached article 11 of its disciplinary regulations relating to "general principles of conduct", and article 12 regarding the "integrity of matches and competitions and match-fixing".

The club's original ban was due to run up to and including the 2034-35 season, and they were also fined €500,000 (£433,000).

Player Nikola Celebic and official Ranko Krgovic were "banned from exercising any football-related activity for life" while three other players - Cetko Manojlovic, Radule Zivkovic and Puletic- were banned for 10 years.

However, following the appeal to the Uefa Appeals Body, the club's ban will now run until the end of the 2031-32 season while the fine has been lowered to €400,000 (£349,000).

And Puletic's appeal has resulted in the Uefa Control, Ethics, and Disciplinary Body's decision from July being overturned, with his suspension annulled.

Arsenal Tivat won a relegation play-off last season to maintain their place in the Montenegrin First League.
