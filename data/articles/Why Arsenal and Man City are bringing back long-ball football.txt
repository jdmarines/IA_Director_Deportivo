Why Arsenal and Man City are bringing back long-ball football

For a long time, hoofing the ball upfield was something associated with teams lower down the leagues.

But recent incomings in the form of Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres for Arsenal, as well as the Manchester City duo of Gianluigi Donnarumma and Erling Haaland, suggest a more direct approach from both teams.

Along with launching goal-kicks, there has been a deliberate effort from both teams to get up the field quickly - through ground passing or dribbling.

In this piece, we analyse City and Arsenal's new direct style, looking at how they use long goal-kicks and quick passing.
